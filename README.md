### ABOUT ME <br />
I'm a tester with more than 5 years of manual testing experience in different projects and tech environments. Gaining knowledge and new challenges fuels my curiosity. As a former academic teacher, I know how important constant self-develop and trying new things is. 

Why software testing is my cup of tea? I always try to find new ways to 'break' things - just to check it's quality.

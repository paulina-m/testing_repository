# 🍕**ABOUT ME** <br />
I'm a tester with more than 5 years of manual testing experience in different projects and tech environments. I thirst for knowledge and new challenges. As a former academic teacher, I know how important is constant self-develop and also trying new things. 

Why software testing is my cup of tea? I always try to find new ways to 'break' things - just to check it's quality.
